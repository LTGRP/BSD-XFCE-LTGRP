```
git clone https://github.com/Wamphyre/BSD-XFCE && sh BSD-XFCE/xfce_desktop.sh
```
## Post-installation (macOS skinpack) <- Optional but recommended

```
IMPORTANT! Run these scripts with your user, not root.

Step 1: cd xfce4BSD-macOS_skinpack/resources/ && sudo sh install_resources.sh
Step 2 (As regular user): cd xfce4BSD-macOS_skinpack/configurations/ && sh apply.sh
```
Please, use this scripts only in a fresh FreeBSD installation.

At some point, the script will ask you for username to enable XFCE start exec and other services like automount capabilities.
